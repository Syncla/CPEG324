# CPEG324
This repository is a collection of all the work that was done during the semester for various projects
Lab 1 was developing an ISA for the calculator that we worked on throughout the semster. The lab was done in c. There were two main parts,
  a compiler and a executor. The compiler took in a text file containing our code in human readable/writable format and converted it to binary code
  The executor took in that code and ran it. Both programs have a verbose output that can be enabled using -v
  
 Lab 2 was developing some basic vhdl skills, not much to it
 
 Lab 3 was taking our ISA from lab 1 and developing a VHDL implementation that would take in binary code and act as the executor from lab 1
 
 Lab 4 was an extra credit lab, where we took the single cycle calculator from lab 3, and created a pipelined calculator with three stages.
